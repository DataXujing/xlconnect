TODOS

- support for row.names ??? --> probably on top of existing R functionality
- support for different date/time classes (see as.POSIXlt)

- probably need workaround for hideSheet in case of XSSF 2 -> hide, 3 -> very hide

- unit test for with.workbook

- execute unit tests independently from R CMD check

- add method for querying name reference formula (+ adapt createName unit test)
   probably also: getDefinedNames -> getNames which return list structure ...?
  
- add demo (demo(...)) and examples in package description

- update package description/documentation

- index, keywords

- license specification

- unit test for "larger" datasets
