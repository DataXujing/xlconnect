TODOS

- support for row.names ??? --> probably on top of existing R functionality
- support for different date/time classes (see as.POSIXlt)

- probably need workaround for hideSheet in case of XSSF 2 -> hide, 3 -> very hide

- unit test for addImage ?
- unit test for with.workbook
- unit test for writeNamedRegion
- unit test for writeWorksheet

- add method for querying name reference formula (+ adapt createName unit test)
   probably also: getDefinedNames -> getNames which return list structure ...?
