TODOS

- support for row.names ??? --> probably on top of existing R functionality
- support for different date/time classes (see as.POSIXlt)
- str, summary methods

- probably need workaround for hideSheet in case of XSSF 2 -> hide, 3 -> very hide

- unit test for addImage ?
- unit test for with.workbook

- add method for querying name reference formula (+ adapt createName unit test)
